## ðŸ“š Course Foundations
This course is largely inspired by:
- **[CS224W - Machine Learning with Graphs (Stanford)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/)**
- **[HSE-GNN - Deep Learning in Graph Analysis](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B2_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B5_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_22/23)**

These resources provide an in-depth look into both network science and GNN theory, design, and implementation.
