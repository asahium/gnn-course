Graph Neural Networks course (WIP)

[Lecture 1 - Intro](\lectures\lecture1)

[Lecture 2 - NoNN Methods](\lectures\lecture2)


The course is largely based on the [CS224W](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) and [HSE-GNN](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B2_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B5_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_22/23) courses, which combines elements of both network analysis and the theory, design, and construction of graph neural networks.
